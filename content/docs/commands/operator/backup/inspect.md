The `operator backup inspect` command displays the details of a backup: its
status per destination, the object counts recorded at backup time, the Norca
version, the Raft index and term, the IDs of the root keys in its keyring,
labels and pinning. The content is not decrypted; use
[`operator backup contents`](/docs/commands/operator/backup/contents) to browse
it.

## Usage

```plaintext
norca operator backup inspect [options] <id>
```

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires the `read` capability of the [`backup` policy](/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#backup-rules).

## General Options

- `-address=<addr>`: The address of the Norca server. Overrides the
  `NORCA_ADDR` environment variable if set. Defaults to
  `http://127.0.0.1:4646`.

- `-region=<region>`: The region of the Norca servers to forward commands to.
  Overrides the `NORCA_REGION` environment variable if set. Defaults to the
  agent's local region.

- `-namespace=<namespace>`: The target namespace for queries and actions bound
  to a namespace. Overrides the `NORCA_NAMESPACE` environment variable if set.
  If set to `'*'`, subcommands which support this functionality query all
  namespaces authorized to user. Defaults to the "default" namespace.

- `-no-color`: Disables colored command output. Alternatively,
  `NORCA_CLI_NO_COLOR` may be set. This option takes precedence over
  `-force-color`.

- `-force-color`: Forces colored command output. This can be used in cases
  where the usual terminal detection fails. Alternatively,
  `NORCA_CLI_FORCE_COLOR` may be set. This option has no effect if `-no-color`
  is also used.

- `-ca-cert=<path>`: Path to a PEM encoded CA cert file to use to verify the
  Norca server SSL certificate. Overrides the `NORCA_CACERT` environment
  variable if set.

- `-ca-path=<path>`: Path to a directory of PEM encoded CA cert files to verify
  the Norca server SSL certificate. If both `-ca-cert` and `-ca-path` are
  specified, `-ca-cert` is used. Overrides the `NORCA_CAPATH` environment
  variable if set.

- `-client-cert=<path>`: Path to a PEM encoded client certificate for TLS
  authentication to the Norca server. Must also specify `-client-key`.
  Overrides the `NORCA_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable if set.

- `-client-key=<path>`: Path to an unencrypted PEM encoded private key matching
  the client certificate from `-client-cert`. Overrides the `NORCA_CLIENT_KEY`
  environment variable if set.

- `-tls-server-name=<value>`: The server name to use as the SNI host when
  connecting via TLS. Overrides the `NORCA_TLS_SERVER_NAME` environment
  variable if set.

- `-tls-skip-verify`: Do not verify TLS certificate. This is highly not
  recommended. Verification will also be skipped if `NORCA_SKIP_VERIFY` is
  set.

- `-token`: The SecretID of an ACL token to use to authenticate API requests
  with. Overrides the `NORCA_TOKEN` environment variable if set.

Each `NORCA_*` environment variable is also accepted with its Nomad name, for
example `NORCA_ADDR` for `NORCA_ADDR`; the `NORCA_*` variable takes precedence
when both are set.

Each `NORCA_*` environment variable above is also accepted with its Nomad
name, for example `NOMAD_ADDR` for `NORCA_ADDR`. The `NORCA_*` variable takes
precedence when both are set.

## Inspect Options

- `-json`: Output the backup in JSON format.

- `-t`: Format and display the backup using a Go template.

## Examples

```shell
$ norca operator backup inspect 20261024T140000Z-1834567
```
